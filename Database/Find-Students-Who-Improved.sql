(student_id, subject, exam_date) is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about a student's score in a specific subject on a particular exam date. score is between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
Write a solution to find the students who have shown improvement. A student is considered to have shown improvement if they meet both of these conditions:

Have taken exams in the same subject on at least two different dates
Their latest score in that subject is higher than their first score
Return the result table ordered by student_id, subject in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.
