    Task
    ----------
    An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

    Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n: int

    Returns
    -------
    out : bool

    Examples
    --------
    >>> isUgly(6)
    True

    Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3

    >>> isUgly(1)
    True

    Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3,
    and 5.

    >>> isUgly(14)
    False

    Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
