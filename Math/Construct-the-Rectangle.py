    Task
    ----------
    A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular
    web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width
    W satisfy the following requirements:

    The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
    The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
    The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
    Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you designed in
    sequence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    area: int

    Returns
    -------
    out : list[int]

    Examples
    --------
    >>> constructRectangle(4)
    [2, 2]

    Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2],
    [4,1].
    But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not
    optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.

    >>> constructRectangle(37)
    [37, 1]

    >>> constructRectangle(122122)
    [427, 286]
